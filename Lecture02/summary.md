# ⚙️ CS50x 2025 – Lecture 2: C (Continued) – Summary

---

## 🚀 Introduction: Lifting the Hood
- 🧩 **Goal:** Understand what happens *under the hood* when a C program is compiled and executed.  
- 💬 **Key Insight:** “By the end of the course, there really won’t be any surprises.”  
- 🧠 **Main Focus:** Remove the “magic” behind compilation and explore debugging, memory, and text handling.

### 🧭 Real-World Motivations
1. **📚 Readability:** Determine the grade level of text using metrics like sentence and word complexity.  
2. **🔐 Cryptography:** Learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages (Caesar cipher).

## 🧮 The Compilation Pipeline
> “make” automates what’s really a 4-step process using the **Clang** compiler.

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Preprocessing** | Handles lines starting with `#`, like `#include <stdio.h>`. It “copy-pastes” header file contents. |
| **2. Compiling** | Translates preprocessed code into **assembly** — low-level instructions like `push`, `move`, `call`. |
| **3. Assembling** | Converts assembly into **machine code** (binary). |
| **4. Linking** | Combines your code’s machine code with library machine code (like `stdio.c`, `cs50.c`). |

💡 **Result:** A final executable file (`hello`, `a.out`, etc.).

## 🐞 Debugging: Finding and Fixing Flaws

### 🖨️ `printf` Debugging
- Insert `printf()` statements to trace variable values during runtime.
- Lets you “see” what your program is thinking step by step.

### 🧰 `debug50` – The CS50 Debugger
- **Breakpoints:** Pause program execution at specific lines.  
- **Step Over / Step Into:** Execute line-by-line or dive into function internals.  
- **Variable Inspection:** View current variable values and detect “garbage values.”  

🧠 **Key Lesson:** Mistakes are normal; debugging is how programmers think clearly.

## 🧱 Memory and Data Structures: Arrays

### 🧩 Memory as a Grid
- Think of memory as a long, continuous row of boxes (bytes).  
- Each variable occupies one or more boxes, each with a unique **address**.

### 🚫 The Problem with Separate Variables
Using many variables (`score1`, `score2`, etc.) is inefficient and unscalable.

### ✅ Arrays to the Rescue
```c
int scores[3];
scores[0] = 72;
scores[1] = 73;
scores[2] = 33;
```
- Store values of the same type **back-to-back** in memory.
- Access them using **zero-based indexing** (`scores[0]`, `scores[1]`, …).  
- Perfect for **loops**:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    printf("%i\n", scores[i]);
```

## 🔤 Strings Revisited: Arrays of Characters

### 💡 What Is a String?
A **string** is just an array of characters in memory:
```
'H' 'I' '!' '\0'
```
- The special `\0` (null terminator) marks the end of the string.  
- The variable name holds the *address of the first character*.  

### 🧰 Libraries for String Manipulation
- **`string.h`** → functions like `strlen()` to measure string length.  
- **`ctype.h`** → character helpers like `isupper()`, `islower()`, and `toupper()`.

🧠 **ASCII Trick:** Uppercase and lowercase letters differ by 32 in ASCII.

## 💻 Command-Line Arguments: Making Programs Interactive

### New `main()` Signature:
```c
int main(int argc, string argv[])
```
| Term | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| `argc` | Number of words typed in the command line. |
| `argv` | Array of those words (as strings). |
| `argv[0]` | Always the program’s name. Arguments start from `argv[1]`. |

Example:
```bash
./greet Hassane
```
```c
printf("Hello, %s!\n", argv[1]);
```

👨‍💻 **Example:** The `cowsay` program uses command-line arguments and flags (e.g., `-f`) to change behavior.

## 🔚 Exit Statuses: Communicating with the System

### Purpose of `int main()`
The integer returned by `main` indicates the **program’s success or failure**.

| Return | Meaning |
|---------|----------|
| `return 0;` | Success ✅ |
| `return 1;` | Error ❌ |

Check it with:
```bash
echo $?
```
> “0 means success by convention… any positive number means failure.”
