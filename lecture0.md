# 📘 CS50x 2025 – Lecture 0: Scratch – Summary

---

## 🚀 Introduction to CS50 and Instructor’s Story
- 🎯 **CS50’s Goal:** Teach the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.
- 👨‍🏫 **David Malan’s Journey:**
  - Initially studied government/history.
  - Discovered CS50 in sophomore year → got "hooked".
- 🌍 **Key Message:** Computer science is applicable in all fields.

---

## 🎢 Course Expectations & Learning Mindset
- 💡 **Challenging but Rewarding:** Like "drinking from a fire hose" 💦.
- 🧠 **Self-Teaching Focus:** Learn how to learn future technologies.
- 📈 **Personal Progress Matters Most:** Compare yourself to your past, not peers.
- ❌ **Mistakes Normalize Learning:** Even Malan once failed “Hello, world”.

---

## 🤝 CS50 Culture and Community
- 🌐 **Shared Experience:** Events like Puzzle Day and Hackathon build community.
- 🔧 **Problem Solving:** Core to CS50's philosophy.
- 🎉 **CS50 Fair:** Final project showcase.

## 🧮 What is Computer Science?
- 🔍 **Definition:** Study of information — representing and processing it.
- 🧩 **Core Skill:** Computational thinking and problem solving.

---

## 💾 Representing Information in Computers
- 🔢 **Binary (0 & 1):** Computers use bits (on/off states).
- 💡 **Transistors:** Like tiny light switches (on = 1, off = 0).
- 📏 **Bytes = 8 Bits:** Can represent 0–255.
- 🔤 **ASCII:** A = 65 in decimal.
- 🌍 **Unicode:** Extended character support (incl. emojis 😄).
- 🎨 **Colors (RGB):** Each pixel stores Red, Green, and Blue values.
- 🖼️ **Images & Videos:** Frames of pixels with color data.
- 🔊 **Sound:** Represented numerically by pitch, volume, etc.

## 📚 Algorithms & Problem Solving
- 🧠 **Algorithm = Precise instructions.**
- 📖 **Phone Book Example:**
  - Linear search – slow.
  - Binary search – fast (log₂ n).
- 💻 **Pseudocode:** Write logic in human-friendly steps.
- ⚙️ **Programming Concepts:**
  - Functions (e.g., `look()`, `call()`).
  - Conditionals (`if`, `else`).
  - Loops (`repeat`, `forever`).
  - Booleans (`true` / `false`).

## 🤖 Intro to AI & Large Language Models (LLMs)
- 💬 **Chatbots:** Rule-based vs. AI-trained models.
- 🧠 **LLMs:** Learn from data using neural networks.
- 🦆 **Rubber Duck Debugging:** Explain your code to a duck (or AI) to solve bugs.

---

## 🧱 Programming with Scratch
- 🪄 **Abstraction:** Hide complexity using higher-level tools.
- 🧠 **From C to Python to Scratch:** Building up layers of abstraction.
- 🧩 **Scratch Basics:**
  - Drag & drop visual blocks.
  - Code in color-coded categories.
  - Use sprites and stage.
- 💬 **First Program:** Say “hello world”.
- 🧪 **Variables & Return Values:** Use `ask` and store the `answer`.
- 🔗 **Combine Inputs:** `join` block acts like string concatenation.
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech:** Make sprites speak using the `speak` block.
- 🔁 **Loops:** Use `repeat` or `forever` to reduce repetition.
- 📦 **Custom Blocks:** Build your own functions to reuse code.
